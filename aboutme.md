subtitle: Why Gustave is really cool :sunglasses:

My name is Gustave and I am a (fighter) robot who's goal is to catch a flag in an arena and to bring it back to my starting point. 

- I have a really useful and aerodinamically acurate spoiler that helps me reaching enormous speed.
- I also am proudly holding a flag to express things.
- I sometimes do what I am intended to do, but most of the time, I do as I please.
