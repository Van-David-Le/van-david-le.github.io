# Issues encountered

- No charger when we first got the robot. We didn't notice until it was the holidays, because when we first tested it, we didn't need it, and didn't even know we were supposed to have one. So we couldn't test it during the holidays.
- Cables. Most of the cables we had were broken, they didn't plug in correctly. And even when we thought the cables worked, our robot behaved erratically. Sure, sometimes it was due to low battery, but we figured out that in the end, it was faulty cables. They made the robot turn at wrong angles, see ghosts values, and other things.
- Gyroscope. We found out during the competition that our gyroscope was not working, values changed while the robot was static, we changed the gyroscope and after one run, it began to give the same aberrant values.
- Ultra sonic sensor. Most of the moving process is based on the values returned by the ultra sonic sensor, it appears that there is a lot of parasitic values that makes the robot see obstacles or wall when there is nothing. It generates a chaotic behaviour is some cases. To fix this problem we tried to average the values returned by the sensor but it broke the entire code when implemented.
